# Snake-Game-Using-Python

This design creates an interactive, continuous play Snake game with simple yet effective animations, screen wrapping, and a responsive control system, making for a fun user experience.

       Python code uses the turtle graphics library to create a classic "Snake" game with a few custom features. Here’s a summary of how the game is designed and functions:
     # Game Area Setup:
    
    The game window is a 500x500-pixel square with a black background.
    The snake moves within the boundaries, but the design allows for screen wrapping—when the snake exits one side of the screen, it reappears on the opposite side, 
    creating a continuous movement environment.
